## Quick Start

### 1. Create a React Project

```bash
npm create vite@latest bloom-with-dignity --template react
cd bloom-with-dignity
npm install
```

### 2. Install TailwindCSS

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

Update `tailwind.config.cjs`:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Replace `src/index.css` with:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
